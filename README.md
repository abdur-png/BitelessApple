# SpecMyPhone

## Overview

Choosing a smartphone, tablet, or laptop involves navigating an array of features and specifications that can be overwhelming. SpecMyPhone aims to simplify this by allowing users to suggest and vote on features they would like to see in these devices. After registering and logging in, users can view various proposed features, upvote them, and even submit their own ideas.

## Data Model

The application will store Users, Phones, and Reviews.

- Users can save multiple phones to their favorites.
- Each phone can have multiple reviews.

An Example User:

```javascript
{
  "username": "TechGeek123",
  "hash": "a_password_hash",
  "savedPhones": // an array of references to Phone documents
}
```

An Example List with Embedded Items:

```javascript
{
  "brand": "Apple",
  "model": "iPhone 13",
  "specs": {
    "screenSize": "6.1 inches",
    "battery": "3200 mAh",
    ...
  },
  "reviews": [
    { "user": "techgeek123", "rating": 5, "comment": "Loved the camera!"},
    ...
  ],
  "createdAt": // timestamp
}

```

## Research Topics

Perform client-side form validation using custom JavaScript or JavaScript library:

1. Utilize React's controlled components for form inputs to ensure that the state always represents the input value.
2. Incorporate custom JavaScript validation functions that check form inputs, such as email format, password strength, or phone model uniqueness.
3. Integrate libraries like react-hook-form or formik to handle complex validation and form management seamlessly.

Errors must be integrated into the DOM:

1. Display form validation errors directly in the UI, right below the associated input field.
2. Utilize React's conditional rendering to display error messages only when there's a validation error for a specific input field.
3. Ensure that errors are not only clear and descriptive but also accessible for screen readers and compliant with web accessibility standards.

Use a CSS framework or UI toolkit, with a reasonable amount of customization of the framework (don't just use stock Bootstrap - minimally configure a theme):

1. Bootstrap: Integrate Bootstrap with React using the react-bootstrap library for a seamless experience. Customize Bootstrap's default theme using SCSS variables to reflect the unique branding of "SpecMyPhone".
2. Enhance the user interface with Bootstrap's responsive grid system, ensuring the website is mobile-friendly and looks great on devices of all sizes.
3. For dynamic UI components, utilize React-Bootstrap components like Modals, Dropdowns, and Alerts to keep the consistency of the UI and ensure better integration with the React lifecycle.
